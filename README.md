### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### About Me 

Hi, I'm Frank Bishop. I am a Full Stack Web Developer.

I have been working in the tech industry for a long time and I have liked it, but I have been wanting to move into a new career within the same industry. I have always been fascinated with how things work and building things. So when researching potential careers to change too, those are things that really stood out to me about development and made me think that I might like it.

As someone that loves computers and spends most of my spare time on them, I loved finding out how the tech worked and what went into creating the sites and apps that I interacted with daily. What I love even more is the sense of accomplishment that I get from building my own functional apps.

When I started, all I could do is render some HTML on a page, but I have gone from those humble origins and have now been able to develop a full stack application of my own using React.

I am dedicated to continuing to learn more and more about development, and I am excited about what I might build in the future.

### Skills

JavaScript(ES5/ES6), HTML5, CSS3, React, SQL, PostgreSQL, Express.js, Node.js, npm, webpack, Babel
